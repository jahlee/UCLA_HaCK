# UCLA_HaCK Automated Arena Mapping Car

September 18-20, 2020

Project that uses code to communicate with the arduino + code to display the data onto a python GUI.

EXTRA TESTING FILES are not needed. They were just in case we needed to do things, or to test the functionality of other files.

PYTHON FILES include 
  getData.py which gets the data form the arduino file, and 
  GUI.py which should be run to set up the connection to the arduino and run the gui.

ARDUINO FILES include 
  moveWheel files which will move the wheels, 
  getSensorData files that get the senor readings form the side of the car, and 
  run.ino which is the file you should run/upload to the arduino.
